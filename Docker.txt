docker run -it ubuntu
this command help to create container which have ubuntu operating system in it
hub.docker.com help to create container, and this is like github, it has all public container if you already have ubuntu img then it reuses
This container have particular id and it is isolated, imgs are operating systems, container needs imgs i.e os
img act as os and containers helps to run imgs  
containers cannot communicate with each other they are isolated, until and unless our wish

ctrl + d = stop container

we can make custom imgs,  that will have their own dependencies
these imgs can deploy on public platforms so any one can run this img in their local containers


docker container ls
it gives list of container which are running, this command works when your containers are running

docker container ls -a 
it gives list of all containers which are stooped and which are working

docker start container name = to start 

docker start container name = to start

docker 
how to go inside of container 
docker exec -it container_name command

-it = interactive tdy, it hepls to connect terminal to docker terminal so that you can perform commands in container

for eg. 
docker exec -it container_name bash

to see the imgs we can do
docker images
docker images ls

there are lots of imgs, we can explore that through docker.hub.com
