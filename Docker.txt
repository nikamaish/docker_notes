docker run -it ubuntu
this command help to create container which have ubuntu operating system in it
hub.docker.com help to create container, and this is like github, it has all public container if you already have ubuntu img then it reuses
This container have particular id and it is isolated, imgs are operating systems, container needs imgs i.e os
img act as os and containers helps to run imgs  
containers cannot communicate with each other they are isolated, until and unless our wish

ctrl + d = stop container

we can make custom imgs,  that will have their own dependencies
these imgs can deploy on public platforms so any one can run this img in their local containers
